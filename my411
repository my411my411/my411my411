 A personal loan can help you cover an emergency expense, consolidate debt, make a home improvement, and more. The best personal loans feature low annual percentage rates (APRs), no fees, repayment terms that fit your budget, and an easy application process.

Investopedia rigorously researched 59 lenders and ranked them on those features, including criteria informed by a survey of hundreds of personal loan borrowers. LightStream, the online lending subsidiary of Truist Bank, ticks all the boxes (competitive APRs, no fees, flexible repayment terms) and is our choice for the best personal loan.

However, another lender may be better for you, depending on your circumstances. Learn more about LightStream and Investopediaâ€™s other picks below.
